Hi, I am Marco :v:. I am currently studying Computer Science at DHBW Karlsruhe since 2019. 

Current projects (:star: = under development, :unlock: = maintainted)

:star: sita-website, a frontend-backend application for our private gaming group.

:unlock: GitGood, a dart counting website, developed as a project at the DHBW. 

I usually develop in Java, Kotlin and TypeScript using IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code and Eclipse.
