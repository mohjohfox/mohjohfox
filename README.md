Hi, I am [Marco](https://mohjohfox.de/) :v:. I am currently studying Computer Science at [DHBW Karlsruhe](https://www.karlsruhe.dhbw.de/startseite.html) since 2019. 

Current projects (:star: = under development, :unlock: = maintainted)

:star: [sita-website](https://simpletactics.de/), a frontend-backend application for our private gaming group.

:unlock: [GitGood](https://gitgood.mohjohfox.de/), a dart counting website, developed as a project at the DHBW. 

I usually develop in Java, Kotlin and TypeScript using IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code and Eclipse.
